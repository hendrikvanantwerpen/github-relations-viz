\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Context of the project
    \item What is intersting about GitHub
    \item What is the challenge
    \item Introduce what we did
\end{itemize}

\section{GitHub data analysis}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What data did we have
    \item Some statistics about the data
    \item What where the processing steps we took
\end{itemize}

\section{MapReduce on Scala Collections}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Where did the idea come from, what did we want to address
    \item How was it implemented in Scala
    \item What design choices where made in the implementation
    \item How is the code compared to hand-written?
    \item How is performance compared to hand-written code?
    \item Some code samples (maybe Haskell equivalents for explanation?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed data-processing with Akka}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What did we want to address
    \item How did we design the actors, where was the caching, where which processing steps
    \item What was the performance (did we speed up response time?)
    \item A design diagram
\end{itemize}

\section{Visualization in the browser with D3}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What did we want to show?
    \item How did we implement it (D3, what graph parameters)
    \item How did we emphasize characteristics (e.g. central projects)
    \item An example result
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and further research}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Did it work
    \item Is it responsive?
    \item Did we show interesting things
    \item What more interesting things could fit in this framework?
\end{itemize}
